## About Me§§§

I'm a Web Developer currently based on São Carlos - Brazil.§§ I have been \
graduated as a Bachelor of Computer Science on July/2015 by University of São \
Paulo.§§§

Working with a great team on a company called Async Open Source, I have been \
building Rich Internet Applications on the last 2 years.§§§ Even though I'm working \
a full time job at Async, I always like to hear from good projects§§§ - maybe I can \
do something quick for you :).
